Check out the description!
Details of this implementation become clearer upon browsing through the test files in the test/ folder.
In particular, page table virtual address and physical address ranges are both provided along with
a map of references to the page table entries (with a dot '.' marking an uninitialized entry with no
references, otherwise digits '1'-'9' denoting the number of references to an entry, and symbol '*' for
entries with greater than 9 references).
To access this information in the OS's filesystem execute the sequence of commands shown in the .sh
file in test/.
